# OPUS-interface

With OPUS repository interface, one can upload parallel files in different languages, and the repository backend aligns them on sentence level. A public instance of the interface is running at https://opus-repository.ling.helsinki.fi/.

## Home page

On the home page, users can create new and view existing corpora, as well as assign new user groups to manage access rights and view existing groups. Clicking on "+" -buttons creates new instances, while "-" -buttons delete existing instances.

## Corpus view page

The corpus page allows users to upload, view, import and download files among other features. Files containing different languages are aligned with each other if they have the same name. To upload files, click the "+" -button next to the "uploads" header. Files are accessed by browsing the directory trees. Clicking the "+" button next to the "parallel" header opens manual file alignment view.
